        <title>Darren Zhang - Bio</title>
 <body>
    My name is Darren Zhang and I am an advertising major. The reason why I chose this major is because I like an industry that’s creative and everchanging. I would love to work in the automotive side of advertising, whether that’s promoting a new car or some features, I am all up for it. My end goal would be to work in Formula 1. I love to play videogames, and I am pretty good at some of them, with one of them being League of Legends as I’ve hit Masters three times on different accounts. I also love to sing and act, but that has been put aside as of the moment due to all the chaotic events happening around the entertainment industry. Outside of school, I love to play videogames, but I also LOVE to binge TV shows and movies. Some of my favorite movies include Spiderman Across the Spiderverse, Oppenheimer, and Interstellar. I am also a pretty big musical theatre person as I find that often the most talented actors, singers, and dancers are in musical theatre. A little more about my upbringing: I was born in San Jose, California, but my family migrated to Shanghai, China when I just turned 1 year old. I stayed there for 17 more years until college, and here I am now! I am excited for IST 263 and cannot wait to grasp the skills of creating and designing websites!
